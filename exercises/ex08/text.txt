At this holy time, our nation is engaged in a battle like never before -- the invisible enemy. Our brave doctors, nurses, and responders -- first responders, responders of all -- are fighting to save lives. Our workers are racing to deliver critical medical supplies. Our best scientists are working around the clock to develop lifesaving therapeutics, and I think they're doing really well in doing so. Our people are making tremendous sacrifices to end this pandemic.
